** Original Update Statics Packet **
14 bytes + 7 bytes per static 
00    0x3f      Command 
02    ushort    Size of packet
06    uint      Block Number
10    uint      Number of statics
14    uint      Extra value for the index file - this will be split up and used for the
                Ultima Live custom protocols
Static[number of statics]    7 bytes
		  ushort      ArtID
		  byte        X offset in the block

** Server Packet: QueryClientHash (Update Statics) **
0x3f		Packet Number
ushort	Packet Size
uint		Block Number central block of 25 requested
uint		0	(no statics sent)
ushort		Command / Security Number. 
			Normall this is a security number. This will be used to make sure that players can't
            spam the server with unrequested Query Responses. Not Implemented yet. 
			If the next field is 0x7F, this will be a command number.
			Commands:
			0x00	Update Statics
			0x01	Map Definition
ushort		Normally this is the map ID. If its a query, it will be 0xFF, if its another command it will be 0x7F

uint        Number of Blocks  	4 blocks x 7 bytes = 28 bytes are expected in 
								the statics portion of this packet
